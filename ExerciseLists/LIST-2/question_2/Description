    Write a Java program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle
using encapsulation. To do this, create a Rectangle class with the attributes
private height and width. This class will have methods that calculate the area (height *
width) and the perimeter (height * 2) + (width * 2). In another RectangleTest class,
Instantiate an object of the Rectangle class and pass the height and width values ​​as
parameter for the created methods. Finally, print the area and perimeter of the rectangle
in this second class.
